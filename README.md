# ðŸ“Š Workforce & Project Performance Insights: 
 <b> Identifying Key Areas of Concern </b>

This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from a workforce and project performance dataset. The primary objective was to identify departments and projects that are currently over budget or underperforming, paving the way for informed corrective actions.

##  Project Overview

This project involved a comprehensive analysis of data consolidated from seven distinct Excel tables. The process included meticulous data cleaning and the strategic combination of these tables into a unified dataset. Leveraging the power of Power BI, a "Profit" column was calculated to provide a clear financial performance indicator for each department.

The core focus was to answer the critical question: **Which departments are not generating profit and what actionable insights can be derived to address this?**

##  Dataset Structure

The dataset comprised information extracted and integrated from the following seven Excel tables:

* `Employees.xlsx`, `Projects.xlsx`, `Departments.xlsx`, `SalaryData.xlsx`, `ProjectCosts.xlsx`, `DepartmentBudgets.xlsx`, `PerformanceMetrics.xlsx`

This integrated dataset provided a holistic view of our workforce, projects, and departmental finances.

## Key Findings: Unprofitable Departments

The analysis revealed that the following two departments are currently operating without generating profit:

* **Human Resources:** Profit of **-Â£92,000** ðŸ”´
* **IT:** Profit of **-Â£112,500** ðŸ”´

##  Actionable Insights & Recommendations

Based on the initial analysis, the following actionable insights warrant further investigation and potential implementation:

**For Both Human Resources & IT:**

* **Detailed Structural and Role Analysis:** Conduct an in-depth examination of the team structure, individual roles, and corresponding responsibilities within both the HR and IT departments. This analysis aims to identify any potential redundancies, overlaps in responsibilities, or areas where tasks could be optimized through streamlining or automation. The goal is to optimize salary costs without compromising essential functions.
* **Comprehensive Project Cost Breakdown & ROI Evaluation:** Deconstruct the total Project Cost for each department into its constituent projects. For each project, meticulously evaluate its return on investment (ROI) and its overall necessity in contributing to the organization's strategic goals.
* **Project Prioritization & Optimization:** Based on the ROI and necessity evaluation, critically assess whether any current projects can be strategically delayed, carefully scaled back in scope, or, if deemed non-essential or low-value, potentially eliminated to achieve immediate cost reductions.

##  Next Steps

Further analysis should delve deeper into the specific cost drivers within HR and IT projects and operational expenses. Benchmarking against industry standards for similar departments could also provide valuable context.
